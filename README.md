## Diamonds Revenue Dashboard

In this dashboard i am going to explain how i got the the conclusion on which 'type' of Diamonds a jewlery should acquire in order to be able to make a name in the market, be a top seller and make it profiltable while it keeps growing.

Before i get to the conclusions i got after anylizing the data, let me walk you through how i got this conclusions.
I started with a basic description of the database in pandas, then i starting making correlations between variables to observe different scenarios and the performance of the data. At the same time, i analyzed those variables with more weight in the price and i got that both carat, volume and the cut made the difference.

Afterwards, creating the dashboard was a matter of representing the conclusions i wanted to arrive to. I needed to refresh a couple of times how to represent them, create bins, format it, but afterwards, peace of cake.

I made several staudies to arrive to the conclusion, such us:
1. In terms of number of diamonds sold, those of **less than 1k USD represent around 25%** of the total sell and arriving with the average in price (4k USD) to almost 70% of the total sell. 
2. The diference in average of price per cut is **35% between Ideal and Premium**, while the diference in **units sold is only 25%** between the two
3. With this two, we can arrive to the conclusion that the best product to focus on **would be the Ideal Cut**. At the same time you get more units sold, you may get more reviews and a name in the market. So its the best product to invest in!

PS. Wish i could have had more time to develop this. I have a great idea that i discussed with the TL but unfortunately due to the heavy schedule at work wasnt able to develop it.
